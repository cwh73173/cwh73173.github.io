	<p> My name is Carter Henry I'm a junior here at the University of Georgia majoring in Agribusiness, Agricultural and
	Applied Economics. I'm taking fifteen hours this semester so I stay reletivley busy with school work. I am an Ambassador
	for the College of Agricultural and Envirnomental Sciences and I'm involved with a couple of other clubs in my college 
	as well. During my free time I enjoy watching college football, playng golf and hanging out with friends. </p>
		<p> My favorite UGA football players are:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>D'Adre Swift</li>
		<li>Rodrigo Blakenship</li>
		<li>George Pickens</li>
		<ol>
		<p>This summer I'm hoping to have an internship in Washington D.C. working for either senator or congressman
		and work on agricultural issues. After graduation I plan on attending law school and then move into lobbying 
		for agricultural corperations. I would love to work in Washington D.C. in my twenties and then move to either
		Texas or Georgia to work.</p>
